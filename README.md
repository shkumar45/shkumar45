### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my github space. I am a geek with business background and always interested in solving real life problems.

* My Current Work ✈️

Please checkout my apps. 
Currently I am working on everest, which is a simple employee management tool.
Took simple concepts to build it in Java and Reactjs.

Everest can do following
 - Employee and department microservices
 - Resiliency using resiliency4j
 - Service communication between the two microservice Employees and its deparment
 - Service Dicovery
 - Distributed tracing using Zipkin and Sleuth (jaeger can be used to monitoring as well)
 - Cloud config server using github
 - Run the entire setup in k8s.


My Goal is get this production ready with proper ci/cd and run on k8s.

- My Interests ⤴️

I am interested in collaborating 👬 with like mided coders who have similar background as mine
who knows, one day we might be able to sell it ✊

Thanks for visiting 😄.
